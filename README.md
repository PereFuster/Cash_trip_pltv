"域名" (yùmíng) in Chinese refers to a "domain name." It is the human-readable address used to locate resources on the internet, such as websites. A domain name serves as a more user-friendly way to identify and access websites, as it is easier to remember than the numerical IP address associated with a specific web server.

For example, in the domain name "www.example.com," "example.com" is the domain name. These names are essential for navigating the internet, and individuals and organizations register domain names for their websites to make them accessible to users.

"包名" (bāo míng) in Chinese refers to a "package name" in the context of software development, particularly in the Java programming language. In the Java programming language, packages are used to organize and structure code, and the package name is a unique identifier for a set of related classes and interfaces. It is the Bundle ID.
